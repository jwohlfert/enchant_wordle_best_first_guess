# Introduction

The idea behind this repo is to use a data-centered approach to solving the daily puzzle at 
[https://enchantworldle.com/]().
I am doing this mostly for myself as a replacement for using [scryfall.com]() to narrow down my guesses,
but also to keep my data analytics and Pandas skills sharp.
I still use data from Scryfall, but I filter and preprocess it to be more useful in the context of the game.

For now, using this script requires knowing how to use Pandas and Jupyter,
but I intend to make it easier for people without those skills in the future.
Maybe I'll stick a GUI on it at some point, we'll see.

# Setup

Installing the requirements in [requirements.txt]() and running [Main.ipynb](Main.ipynb) should be enough to set up your
environment and get the data that you need. 
After you run the notebook the first time, 
feel free to comment out the first cell until you feel the need to update your data again.
